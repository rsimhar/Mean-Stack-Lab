 third line from the bottom and shows important messages.  The bottom two
 lines show the most commonly used shortcuts in the editor.

 Shortcuts are written as follows: Control-key sequences are notated with
 a '^' and can be entered either by using the Ctrl key or pressing the Esc
 key twice.  Meta-key sequences are notated with 'M-' and can be entered
 using either the Alt, Cmd, or Esc key, depending on your keyboard setup.
 Also, pressing Esc twice and then typing a three-digit decimal number
 from 000 to 255 will enter the character with the corresponding value.
